# Final_Project
Photography website

We separated everything in the MVC 
pattern, having a classes, model, styles, views, and controller
directories. splitting up specific files between those directories.

We have a controller that route each url to different pages, 
and then we globally call them in the index.php using fat-free

We created a database that stores photo shoot requests
with the people information like name, phone number, email,
city, etc. 

We have a summary page where you would be able to do that,
you would be able to make changes to if someone has already booked
a photo shoot or still in process etc.

We committed our work pretty often when we made changes.
As well if we pair programed we made a comment on the commits 
that we worked on together

We are going to have classes that is for photo shoot type, 
if you select a specific type of photo shoot you get a message 
during the results page.

we include DocBlocks in all php files and made comments
as well the rest of the PEAR standards

we have a php file with the validations, using the fat-free framework
to have it be displayed when a specific required input isn't filled out.
